### What is Exchange ?
An exchange is a platform where buyers and sellers meet to trade assets like cryptocurrencies, stocks, or currencies. It acts as a marketplace that matches buy and sell orders. For example, on a crypto exchange, you can swap USD for BTC. Examples of exchanges include Binance and WazirX

### Types of Order
There are two types of Order
1. Market Order 
2. Limit Order

Here is breakdown in detail 

### Market Order 
1. Defination- Buy or sell stocks immediately at current market price  
2. Use case - When you want instant execution  
3. Example: Bitcoin is $30,000. You place a market buy order → it executes at $30,000 (or the nearest available price). 
4. Pros: Fast execution. 

### Limit Order
1. Definition: Buy or sell at a specific price you set. The order only executes if the market reaches your price. 
2. Use case: When you want a better price than the current market. 
Example: BTC is $30,000. You place a limit buy order at $29,500 → it executes only if BTC drops to $29,500. 
3. Pros: Can get a better price. 
4. Cons: Might not execute if the price never reaches your limit.
